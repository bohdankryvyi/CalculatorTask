# ConsoleCalculator_Task1. NEW VERSION
Notes about app:
1. Application.java is a class to run with main.
2. Main will ask user to input values and then will generate Map with possible calculation options
3. Validation is present on inputting values ( can be [-20; 20] )
4. Results are saved into "data.txt" file with a local time of calculation
5. Classes are split into 3 packages ( calculationMethods, view , writing results) based on OOP and Java patterns
6. Classes are refactored to be static and  not to create so many objects
7. Log4j2 is added to log all values that are out of the border [-20;20]

NOTE: Gitignore is not added for some my own configuration purposes, to show logs and to show how data is saved to the file
